MÁLAGA, Spain, Jul 02 (IPS)  - A 280-square-metre warehouse in Coín, a municipality in the southern Spanish province of Málaga, is home to a unique type of farm, where insects are raised for human consumption and the production of animal feed.  But despite FAO's endorsement of insects as food, there are numerous obstacles holding back the development of this industry. The University of Alicante course "Researching Biodiversity: Present and Future" ended in May with a tasting of edible worms and arachnids.
