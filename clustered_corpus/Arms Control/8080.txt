A tribal leader in Sudan's flashpoint region of Abyei has  given a war warning, six days before south Sudan votes on  whether to split from the north. Bishtina Mohammed El Salam of the Misseriya, one of two  dominant tribes in Abyei, said his people will not accept  joining the south following the Jan.  9 referendum. His tribe shares the region with the Dinka, who say they  want to join the south. 'If the Dinka take this decision - to annex Abyei to the  south - there will be an immediate war without any excuse,'  El Salam told Al Jazeera.  'We think they should be  reasonable and think about it.  They should know that those  who are pushing them to take that decision will not give  them any back-up. 'Under a 2005 peace agreement, a separate referendum is to be  held for Abyei's people to opt to join the north or the  south. But issues over borders and residency rights have delayed  that vote, which was due on Jan.  9. Mutual fearAl Jazeera's Mohamed Vall, reporting from Abyei, said there  is a situation of mutual fear between the two tribes in the  region. 'The Dinka have been talking about a local referendum they  are going to organise on their own outside the framework of  the peace agreement between the north and the south,' he  said. 'That has stoked fears among the Misseriya that the Dinka  are about to annex Abyei to the south.  So the Misseriya are  doing this in anticipation, to send a serious warning to the  Dinka and prevent them from such action. 'Abyei sits on the country's ill-defined internal border and  is claimed by both sides.  Both north and south jointly  govern the region under a special administrative status. The south holds a symbolic attachment to the region, as many  of its leading figures come from there, including Salva  Kiir, the leader of South Sudan's semi-autonomous  government. But the Misseriya nomads from the north claim the right to  use its pastures for grazing.
