MEXICO CITY, Jan 16 (IPS)  - "The army decided to open fire on the people," Estanislao Beltrán, a spokesman for the self-defence forces of Michoacán, said in a radio interview after the government's attempt to disarm the vigilante groups in the state of Mexico, in which at least two people were killed. The self-defence groups are still patrolling the town of Nueva Italia in the region of Tierra Caliente in MichoacÃ¡n, ignoring the Mexican governmentâ€™s call for them to lay down their weapons.
