As big a story as this week’s crackdown on anti-government protests in  Thailand is the significant number of journalists killed or hurt, and media  professionals and organisations threatened during the country’s most serious  political conflict in years.    Since April, two foreign journalists, a Japanese and an Italian, have died  from bullet wounds while covering operations against the protests by the  United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), whose supporters are  called red shirts because of their protest colour.    Italian freelance journalist Fabio Polenghi was shot by unidentified gunmen  on Wednesday, during a blockade to end the two-month old UDD rally in the  Rajprasong commercial district.  Reuters cameraman Hiroyuki Muramoto died  during an Apr.  10 attempt to break up protesters at another protest site.    But in addition to the usual risks that come with reporting in conflict  situations, journalists and media organisations found themselves walking a  tightrope of a mix of censorship, accusations of bias, as well as bomb  attacks.    This has kept media rights groups busy, issuing statements that they are  not combatants in the conflict and that both the government and the UDD  must let them to do their job.    'We condemn the intimidation of the media and being the target of the red  shirts yesterday at the height of the crackdown,' Thai Journalists Association  (TJA) vice president Chavarong Limpattamapanee said in a phone interview.    'We are asking the government to stabilise the situation and do whatever  they can to protect the members of the media as well as media offices,' he  said, referring to the arson attacks by angry red shirts on Thai television  Channel 3 Wednesday.  The offices of the English-language dailies 'Bangkok  Post' as well as 'The Nation' were forced to close down in the afternoon that  day after receiving threats.    For two days, government spokesman Panithan Wattanagorn has referred to  the worrisome deaths and targeting of foreign journalists — events that  grabbed international headlines.     'The government of Thailand is committed to make sure that foreigners,  guests of the country will be safe and secure, increase protection for  embassies, tourist locations and especially for foreign media that may be  targeted in this violent acts,' he said on television Thursday.    A Canadian freelance reporter, a Dutch journalist, and a U. S.  documentary  filmmaker were also injured Wednesday.  On May 14, during clashes between  protesters and soldiers, a French cameraman and two photographers from  the Thai-language daily 'Matichon' and 'The Nation' were injured.    There have also been increased tensions between journalists and red shirts  who accuse the media of misinformation.  The ‘Bangkok Post’ reported that  red shirts threatened a journalist doing interviews among them for fear that  the information would be used to undermine the protests.  In March, the  government television station was the target of a grenade attack.    These reflect the deep split in views about the UDD protests, which had  focused on demanding a new election to replace the government of Prime  Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva.    According to Thai journalist Noi Thammasathien of the U. S.  media training  network Internews, the Thai mainstream media have been split into the  'yellow' and the 'red' camps, the former being associated with pro- government groups and the latter with the UDD.    'The media have been under tremendous pressure, especially from the  government, the military and their supporters.  So observers say media  content has not been satisfying for other sectors, like the red shirts, because  they believe that self-censorship is at work here,' said Noi.    Often, rights advocate Dewi Ratnawulan says, media from both the  government and opposition have become instruments of agitation and  discord.  This has eroded their credibility, 'perhaps one of the reasons why  media organisations have been the target of attacks. '   'Apart from the obvious bias of reporting in the mainstream media  identified with the government, the red shirts’ media are also guilty of the  same with information meant to fuel an already tense situation within the  rally site,' said Ratnawulan of the regional human rights organisation Forum- Asia.     But 'there is no government interference in the print media,' TJA’s  Chavarong said, despite the state of emergency.  Television stations, he  added, were asked in a meeting with the government to cooperate with them  in the light of the emergency.  'There were no written orders but merely  suggestions on how to cover the crisis situation,' he explained.    Violence, including arson attacks that gutted more than 35 buildings,  erupted hours after UDD leaders surrendered as troops closed in on the  Rajprasong site on Wednesday.    The protesters had been camped out there since Apr.  3, demanding a new  poll because they say the current government came to power not through  elections but with the military’s aid.  The UDD has as its patron fugitive ex- Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who is popular among the rural poor.         As of Thursday, officials said 44 people had died and 384 injured since May  14 when troops started mobilising troops in preparation for a dispersal.    The foreign media, Noi observes, have been more like a 'helper' in the  news situation in that many, especially the red shirts, look at them as those  'who could give balanced information' if only because they are ‘outsiders'.     Lamenting the foreign journalists’ deaths, Chavarong said that some might  have had the tendency to underestimate the Thai situation and been 'too  confident owing to their training on conflict reporting'.    'The Thai reporters don't have that same kind of conflict reporting training  and so tend to be on the safer side.  What they usually do is to follow the  instructions of officers.  This is why in the Apr.  10 clashes, no local journalists  were wounded,' Chavarong explained.    But in recent days that saw the involvement of unidentified snipers, the  situation became harder to navigate.    'We didn't know where the bullets were coming from.  The main problem is  that this was not a normal peaceful demonstration.  And on the final day of  the crackdown, we got word that red shirts planned to target all journalists on  the ground and threaten them with bodily harm,' said Chavarong.  *The Asia Media Forum (http://www. theasiamediaforum. org) is a space for  journalists to share insights on issues related to the media and their  profession.
