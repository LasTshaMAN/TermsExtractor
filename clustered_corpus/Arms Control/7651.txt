On a windy morning in southern Laos in November, a team of  deminers built a makeshift bunker out of sandbags and piled  the barrier around a tiny explosive.    A thin electrical wire snaked its way from the bunker,  100 metres down a bumpy dirt road, to where the deminers had  huddled.    Years ago, when this region of South-east Asia was  engulfed in a simmering war of ideology, this pathway carved  out of the hillside was a small part of the Ho Chi Minh  Trail.  The North Vietnamese army built its supply line  through the mountains cutting through Laos, using the route  to fuel its operations in the south in its war against the  U. S.  government.    And so this area became the target of air strikes from  the U. S.  military.  For a decade between 1964 to 1973, U. S.   planes rained bombs down on the fields, roads and villages  along the way.  When the planes dropped cluster munitions,  each bomb dispersed hundreds of tiny explosives on to the  ground below.  By the time the war ended, Laos had become the  most heavily bombed country on the planet.    But though the fighting has long been over, the danger  lingers.  An estimated 30 percent of those cluster  submunitions, or bombies, as they are known in Laos, failed  to explode.  In Laos’s impoverished south, they still litter  villages and fields, making them impossible to farm.  And  each year, more men, women and children here stumble on the  bombs, adding to a casualty toll that has already climbed  beyond 50,000 in this country alone.    'Three! Two! One!' A deminer shouted a warning in Lao.  A  button is pressed and the distant bunker exploded, the blast  echoing through the surrounding hills.    For Somphong Chanthavong, an operations coordinator for  the group Norwegian People’s Aid, the sound represents one  fewer bombie that can kill or maim his countrymen.    This remote province is one of the poorest in Laos.  It is  no coincidence, Somphong says, that it is also heavily  contaminated with leftover weapons from a war that ended  some 35 years ago.    'It affects the poor people,' the deminer said.  'If they  have land, they can work.  They can grow rice and crops.  If  the land is contaminated by (unexploded weapons), it is like  a booby trap. '   The Ho Chi Minh Trail stretched from North Vietnam into  Laos, down to Cambodia and to the south.  All three countries  felt the effects of the U. S.  air strikes and remain among  the most contaminated in the world today.  But while the  supply line connected the three countries then, today, their  governments have taken separate diplomatic approaches to the  problem.    Laos has been an active proponent of a landmark treaty  that bans the use of cluster bombs.  On Nov.  8-12, Vientiane  hosted the first high-level meeting of the Convention on  Cluster Munitions since it came into effect in August.    Meanwhile, Cambodia and Vietnam have so far refused to  sign the treaty, frustrating disarmament advocates who had  hoped countries most affected by cluster bombs would take on  leading roles in the ban.    'It’s countries like Vietnam and Cambodia where people  are suffering,' said Thomas Nash, coordinator for the  Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC), which has led the civil  society push behind the ban.    'This treaty is not designed just to ban the weapon.  It’s  designed to help people.  The whole motivation for the treaty  is to end suffering.  So it’s countries like Vietnam and  Cambodia that count for us,' he added.    Cambodia was an early proponent of the treaty, but backed  off when the convention was opened for signing in 2008.   Cambodian officials maintain that they are supportive of the  convention and intend to sign.  But they have also offered  various reasons for why they cannot, from border tensions  with neighbouring Thailand to a need to assess their current  stockpiles following decades of conflict.    Vietnam, too, has expressed support for the convention.   But it has also warned that it may not be able to meet the  treaty’s deadline to clear contaminated land.    However, both countries may be taking significant risks  in not signing the treaty early on, Nash argues.     Advocates say international donor money that funds  clearance projects in the region are barely adequate to  maintain minimal levels.  Officials in all three countries  have warned of fluctuating funding levels that threaten  clearance targets.         But affected countries also have a greater chance of  obtaining clearance funds if they are early adopters of such  international conventions, Nash says.    'In the early years, the political momentum is the  highest, the visibility is strongest and the flow of money  and resources from donors to affected countries is probably  also going to be highest,' Nash said.  'I think Cambodia and  Vietnam have every reason to join the convention and,  really, no reason not to. '    Early on, at least, it appeared some countries were  willing to offer new funding as the spotlight shone on  Vientiane in November.  By the time the conference ended,  Australia, Belgium, Luxembourg, New Zealand and Switzerland  had announced new funds for clearance activities in Laos  totalling more than 6. 7 million U. S.  dollars, according to  the CMC.    It is not an insignificant amount in a country where  clearance operations cost 12 to 14 million dollars each  year.  The group Legacies of War argues that this figure must  be more than doubled for Laos to meet its long-term  clearance goals.    In the meantime, countries that have signed on to the  cluster bomb treaty emerged from the Vientiane meeting with  a clearer idea of how to implement their obligations under  the convention.     While it requires countries to destroy stockpiles within  eight years, states parties agreed to set individual  timelines and budgets for doing so within one year.  They  must also identify all contaminated areas and develop plans  to clear them within that time frame.
