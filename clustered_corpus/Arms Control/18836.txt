LUSAKA, Dic 29 (IPS)  - RIOT POLICE HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED IN THE STREETS OF TWO MAJOR TOWNS IN NORTHERN ZAMBIA, WHERE A SEVERE GRAIN SHORTAGE HAS CAUSED PANIC AMONG RESIDENTS. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BESIEGED MAIZE MEAL OUTLETS IN THE MINING TOWNS OF NDOLA AND KITWE IN A FRENZY OF PANIC BUYING OVER THE PAST TWO DAYS, ACCORDING TO EYE-WITNESSES. FLARED TEMPERS AND A FEW SCUFFLES HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS CONSUMERS JOSTLE FOR THE FEW REMAINING STOCKS OF MAIZE MEAL, THE COUNTRY'S STAPLE FOOD. A POLICE SPOKESMAN SAID OFFICERS IN NDOLA, ZAMBIA'S SECOND LARGEST CITY, LATE WEDNESDAY HAD TO DISPERSE AN UNRULY MOB AS IT SOUGHT TO STAGE A DEMONSTRATION AGAINST THE SHORTAGE AND A RESULTANT PRICE HIKE BY TRADERS. THE PRICE OF MAIZE MEAL IN THE TWO TOWNS HAS SHOT UP FROM AN AVERAGE 4,500 KWACHA (ABOUT SIX DOLLARS) PER 25-KILOGRAM BAG TO 8,000 KWACHA SINCE THE SHORTAGE BEGAN. OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ARE FACED WITH SIMILAR FOOD SHORTFALLS.  IN WESTERN ZAMBIA, FOR EXAMPLE, AT LEAST 25 PEOPLE ARE REPORTED TO HAVE STARVED TO DEATH OVER THE CHRISTMAS WEEKEND. THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES THAT 300,000 FAMILIES - OR APPROXIMATELY 1. 5 MILLION PEOPLE - ARE IN IMMEDIATE DANGER OF STARVATION. HOWEVER, THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE SAYS THE FOOD CRISIS IS AN ARTIFICIAL ONE, CREATED BY INEFFICIENT MILLERS. "THERE IS ENOUGH MAIZE IN THE COUNTRY TO LAST UNTIL MAY," SAYS FOOD SECURITY PERMANENT SECRETARY AUSTIN SICHINGA. ACCORDING TO HIM, "THE CRISIS HAS BEEN CAUSED BY MILLERS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING THEIR SUPPLIERS.  NOW THE SUPPLIERS HAVE STOPPED DELIVERING SUPPLIES TO THEM. "MILLERS, HOWEVER, INSIST THAT GRAIN STOCKS HAVE ALL BUT RUN OUT AND IMPORTS ARE INEVITABLE. "WE ARE ALREADY MAKING ARRANGEMENTS TO IMPORT AT LEAST 3,000 TONNES OF GRAIN FROM SOUTH AFRICA," A MANAGER AT MULUNGUSHI MILLING COMPANY SAID.
