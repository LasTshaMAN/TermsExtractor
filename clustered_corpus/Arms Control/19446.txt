LONDON, Dic 30 (IPS)  - Base metal markets had a busy post- Christmas market with copper soaring through the psychologically- important 3,000 dollars a tonne barrier for three-month basis.

By the next day's close copper had risen comfortably and smashed through resistance to rest at 3,016. 5 dollars a tonne, 3,002. 5 dollars a tonne for three-month. "This is an important stage for copper as now it is free to move within a higher range and this could be start of a major upward price hike," said sources. Copper is used in wiring and electronic goods and is an important indicator of the direction of all base metals, which tend to follow it in price terms. This Friday evening it ended well-strengthened at 3,040 dollars a tonne for cash, 3,014. 5 dollars a tonne for three-month.
