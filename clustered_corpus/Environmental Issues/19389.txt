MELVIS DZISAH  ABIDJAN, Nov 15 (IPS)  - THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRIME MINISTER DANIEL KABLAN DUNCAN PLANS TO REHABILITATE COTE D'IVOIRE'S BIGGEST URBAN GHETTOES STARTING NEXT YEAR. THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMME WILL INCLUDE THE OVERHAUL OF WATER, ELECTRICITY AND ROAD SYSTEMS, ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL OF THE MINISTRY OF URBANISATION AND CONSTRUCTION. THE OFFICIAL TOLD IPS "MOST OF THE LABOUR FORCE IN THE COUNTRY LIVES IN SHANTY-TOWNS"AND "RESIDENTS THERE DESERVE BETTER THAN THEY ARE GETTING NOW. "THOUSANDS OF RURAL PEOPLE, MAINLY UNEMPLOYED YOUTHS, BEGAN MIGRATING TO COTE D'IVOIRE'S CITIES IN THE EARLY 1970S, BUT ONLY A FEW HAD BEEN ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR DREAMS.  THE REST, DISAPPOINTED BUT DETERMINED, STAYED ON AND ERECTED SQUATTER CAMPS IN AND AROUND THE TOWNS. THERE ARE 72 SHANTY-TOWNS IN ABIDJAN, THE COUNTRY'S ADMINISTRATIVE CAPITAL, ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT BY THE MINISTRY OF URBANISATION AND CONSTRUCTION HERE. "FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OUT OF A POPULATION OF TWO MILLION LIVE IN THE SHANTY TOWNS" IN ABIDJAN, ACCORDING TO THE REPORT.  BUT SOCIAL WORKERS PUT THE NUMBER AT ABOUT A MILLION. ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS SHANTY-TOWNS IS 'WASHINGTON', TUCKED BETWEEN ABIDJAN'S TWO MOST EXPENSIVE BUSINESS AND RESIDENTIALS AREAS, PLATEAU AND COCODY. IN THESE TWO NEIGHBOURHOODS WATER, ELECTRICITY AND BEAUTIFUL AVENUES ARE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. THE COCODY RESIDENT TURNS ON A KNOB AND WATER GUSHES OUT UNTIL IT IS TURNED OFF.  HE PRESSES A SWITCH AND HE HAS ELECTRICITY.  IN THE EVENINGS HE STROLLS WITH HIS DOGS IN ABIDJAN'S SPLENDID AVENUES, PROTECTED BY SECURITYMEN AT EVERY TURN OF THE STREET. BUT WASHINGTON'S SHABBY WOODEN HOUSES HAVE NO RUNNING WATER.  THE SLUM'S INHABITANTS DIG SHALLOW WELLS FROM WHICH THEY OBTAIN THE PRECIOUS LIQUID.  AND, POOR AS THEY ARE, THE GHETTOES ARE HAVENS FOR THIEVES, PROSTITUTES AND DRUG PEDDLERS. ACCORDING TO 65-YEAR-OLD PAPA AMADOU: "LIVING IN WASHINGTON IS LIKE LIVING IN HELL. "
