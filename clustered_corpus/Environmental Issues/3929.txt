If some Asian states appeared to be disunited in the lead-up to the climate  change talks currently underway in Copenhagen, now they are rising in unison  to get the developed world to accede to their demands. 'Asian countries had shown least cooperation in the past, but climate change  seems to have united them,' said Rajesh Mehta, a climate campaigner from  India, who works with Action Aid International, a global anti-poverty  organisation. Developing countries want a firm commitment from rich nations to undertake  a strong greenhouse gas emission (GHG) target and assist them in addressing  the impacts of this global phenomenon.  Still another contentious issue that  has emerged in the final round of climate talks in the Danish capital and  which appeared to have deepened the discord between the two groups of  countries is when poor nations should start cutting emissions.   'The developed countries are reluctant to recognise the right of developing  countries to emission space,' charged Chinese ambassador and negotiator  Qingtai Yu during a panel discussion organised late last week by the  independent media group Climate Change Media Partnership, where  delegates from industrialised and poor countries were invited.   The discussion focused on the vastly contrasting positions of the rich and  poor countries on the issue of climate change agreement.  For instance,  representatives of major emerging economies in Asia, China and India,  asserted that they should get a chance at economic development, expressing  their disfavor of binding emission cuts.  The industrialised nations have  insisted that major developing countries must also assume emission  obligations. 'What they say to us is this: What is mine is mine; what I have taken from you,  I have got a right to keep it.  But you have no such right,' said Qingtai,  addressing representatives from rich nations during the forum.  'Our emission  space is occupied and we want it back. '  Indian negotiator Chandershakher Dasgupta could not agree more, saying  developing countries were demanding 'climate justice' to allow their  economies to grow.  He added that despite the Convention on Climate Change  having been ratified by close to 200 countries, it had been ineffective. 'The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCC)  required the Annex 1 (or industrialised) countries to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions by (an average of) 5. 2 percent from the 1990 level, but we could  see nothing of that sort happening even as the Convention is in place for over  a decade (now),' he said. 'We the people of different Asian countries are suffering almost similarly, so  how can we afford to have differences,' Nepalese negotiator Purushottam  Ghimire told IPS.  He added South Asians were all united on the issue of  climate  He could not have been talking about the evident lack of cooperation among  South Asian states when a regional climate conference for South Asia was  held just three months ago in Kathmandu in Nepal.  The low turnout of official  delegates dismayed those who came.        'Out of the eight participating countries from the region, only three sent their  environment ministers while the rest sent only their representatives such as  their secretaries deputy secretaries and undersecretaries,' said a South Asian  official, who declined to be named, in an earlier interview with IPS. The event, dubbed, 'From Kathmandu to Copenhagen: A Vision for  Addressing Climate Change Risks and Opportunities in the Himalaya Region',  sought to hammer out a regional position on the impacts of climate change  and how these be addressed. At Copenhagen delegations from smaller and poorer Asian states also appear  to be forging a consensus that India and China should take the lead in  ensuring that the developing world gets a fair and equitable commitment  from the developed states.   More then 100 world leaders, including U. S.  President Barack Obama, are  expected to assemble at Copenhagen late this week for the climate summit. 'India is a major country in the region.  Therefore, it has a responsibility to its  neighbours as well,' said Manzoor-ul-Hanan Khan, a delegate from  Bangladesh, in an interview with IPS. India and China refuse to be bound by a legally binding GHG reduction  targets.  Such a stance has put them on collision course with industrialised  countries and even smaller developing countries across Asia, which are eager  to see a legally binding treaty come out of Copenhagen. 'You are talking about the right to pollute the atmosphere,' said Karl  Falkenberg, a delegate from the European Commission, who participated in  the forum.  'The bottom line is that I don’t know (if there's) any right to  pollute either for developed or developing countries.  We need to make sure  that cleaner technology is used for development. '    But Bangladeshi chief negotiator, Qaumurl Islam Chowdhary, said the  apparent disagreement between India and China on one side and other  developing nations on the other did not mean there was a division within the  Asian ranks.  'The G77/China block of developing countries is quite united and rock- solid,' he said, adding that the 'differences were not even at the regional  levels. '      Chowdhary added the developing countries would not be able to cope with  climate change without a legally binding instrument that would allow their  collective concerns to be addressed properly.  We, especially the least  developed countries, can’t build the coping capacity unless there is a robust  agreement. 'He cited the need to amend the Long-Term Cooperating Action, which spells  out the level of emission cuts that the developed world is expected to meet,  and produce a new agreement 'that fixes the responsibilities of the  polluters,' he said.  Notwithstanding the raging debates among nations big and small at  Copenhagen, he said he was still hoping that a 'consensus would be  reached'. Indian negotiator Chandershakher Dasgupta shared Chowdhary’s cautious  optimism.  'Progress has been rather disappointing in the first week, but we  are hopeful that good sense will prevail for reaching an agreement. '
