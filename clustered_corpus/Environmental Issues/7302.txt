When dark clouds waft above, hearts pound in fear and  nightmarish thoughts strike the minds of the inhabitants of  this desert town, which lies more than 3,048 metres above sea  level in the northern Indian province of Ladakh.    Located more than 1,000 kilometres from New Delhi, Ladakh  is part of the western Himalaya where extreme weather  conditions are common — the cold and dry kind, that is.     Usually, precipitation in Ladakh, which sits on the  western part of the Tibetan plateau, does not even reach 20  centimetres in a whole year.  Yet on Aug.  6, cloudbursts  dumped as much as 250 cm of rain on Ladakh in just one hour,  causing landslides and floods that left at least 233 people  dead and thousands more homeless.    Says Pintoo Narbo, one of the many Leh residents who are  still traumatised by the tragedy: 'We have never heard of a  disaster of this kind in Ladakh’s history. '   Still, even before record rainfall doused Ladakh in  August, residents of its 241 villages were already wondering  about the curious changes in weather and temperature that  were wreaking havoc on the way they live.    Chewang Norphel can still vividly recall how he and his  fellow villagers here would walk over the surface of the  Khardungla glacier.  But he says the glacier 'has now  completely vanished, while the glaciers like Stok Kangri are  receding rapidly'.      In fact, Norphel earned the monicker ‘Iceman’ not for his  exploits over frozen surfaces, but for his pioneering  contribution of creating artificial glaciers for the use of  farmers in the initial stage of cultivation season.    'Whether you call it climate change or attribute it to  any other natural process, we are experiencing a lot of  changes around us,' Lobzang Tsultim, executive director of  the non-profit Leh Nutrition Project, tells IPS.     'Our region is known as an arid region and we have small  glaciers, which we draw water from,' he says.  'But over the  last several years, many of these glaciers have receded.  Not  only this, we have seen some of our limited pasture lands  drying up because of water scarcity. '    'The winters are getting shorter and warmer,' says farmer  Tashi Namgiyal.  'The snowfall… melts quickly. ' He says the  popular ‘Chadar Trek’, which Zanskar natives had done for  generations during winter, when the Zanskar River surface  would freeze solid, is now possible for a mere two months.   Previously, he says, it 'used to be from December to March. '   'We are now seeing pests even in upper villages while  they were earlier found only in villages lying lower,'  Namgiyal adds, pointing to more consequences of the changing  conditions.  'We are also witnessing a shift in sowing and  harvesting of barley. '   For sure, the villagers are not imagining things.  At the  very least, S N Mishra of Indian Meteorological Department  says, the mean temperature in Ladakh from the months of  November to March has increased one degree Centigrade while  mean maximum temperature for summer months has increased by  0. 5 degree Centigrade.    Yet it did take until August’s cloudbursts before Ladakh  villagers began thinking that they may be unable to continue  farming as they had been doing for centuries.     Indeed, the floods washed away crops, along with huge  chunks of cultivable land.   According to official figures,  1,420 hectares of land were affected by the floods and 51  percent of crops, which included barley and vegetables, were  damaged.    'Until last (August), we were only worried about water  getting scarcer with glaciers retreating rapidly,' says  Narbo.  'But now we are worried about our survival as well. '   'The damage is very extensive,' confirms Robert Folkes,  emergency officer of the non-government organisation Save  the Children, referring to the effects of the recent floods.     'The farmers certainly need… machines and manual labour  for clearing the layers of silt from their fields,' he says.   'They also need help from the local government and the NGOs  for repairing the damage caused to the irrigation system as  agriculture mainly depends on irrigation in Ladakh. '    Those like geographer Mohammed Sultan, who teaches at  Kashmir University, says that a single weather event like  the cloudburst is not necessarily a sign of climate change,  but agrees that 'the increase in extreme weather events  suggests that climatic conditions in Ladakh are changing'.    'Given that the winters are getting shorter and warmer  and also the fact that many small glaciers are retreating  fast and snowlines are receding, not only common people, but  also climate change experts, tend to view these changes with  concern,' adds Badrinath Balaji, who has worked as a  forester here for many years.         Still, the August disaster has heightened the fear of  farmers here that they may one day have to abandon Ladakh.   Since they know the deluge has something to do with the  changing weather patterns and unpredictable temperatures,  many farmers here have been reminded of it — ironically  enough — through their diminishing water supply.     'Farming is the only art we know and obviously our  children will also be dependent on agriculture,' says Sonam  Tundup, a farmer in Stakmo village.  'If there is no water  left, there would be no agriculture, meaning our children  might have to leave this land one day in search of water. '    But Leh Nutrition Project’s Tsultim asserts that adapting  to the changing climate is the better option.  'You have to  either adapt or become extinct,' he says.  'Though I am sure  that we are paying for none of our faults, we have to think  about adapting to the changes, which are taking place due to  the actions of the developed world (in producing greenhouse  gases).
