WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (IPS)  - If people outside the United States are looking for answers why Americans often seem so clueless about the world outside their borders, they could start with what the three major U. S.  television networks offered their viewers in the way of news during 2013. moore tornado 640Syria and celebrities dominated foreign coverage by ABC, NBC, and CBS â€" whose combined evening news broadcasts are the single most important media source of information about national and international events for most Americans.  Vast portions of the globe went almost entirely ignored, according to the latest annual review by the authoritative Tyndall Report. 3Latin America, most of Europe and sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia apart from Afghanistan, and virtually all of East Asia â€" despite growing tensions between China and Washingtonâ€™s closest regional ally, Japan â€" were virtually absent from weeknight news programmes of ABC, NBC, and CBS last year, according to the report, which has tracked the three networksâ€™ evening news coverage continuously since 1988. Out of nearly 15,000 minutes of Monday-through-Friday evening news coverage by the three networks, the Syrian civil war and the debate over possible U. S.  intervention claimed 519 minutes, or about 3. 5 percent of total air time, according to the report. That made the Syrian conflict and the U. S.  policy response the yearâ€™s single-most-covered event.  It was followed by coverage of the terrorist bombing by two Chechnya-born brothers that killed three people at the finish line of last Aprilâ€™s Boston Marathon (432 minutes); the debate over the federal budget (405 minutes); and the flawed rollout of the healthcare reform law, or Obamacare (338 minutes). The next biggest international story was the death in December of former South African President Nelson Mandela (186 minutes); the July ouster of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi and its aftermath; the coverage of Pope Francis I (157 minutes, not including an additional 121 minutes devoted to Pope Benedictâ€™s retirement and the Cardinalsâ€™ conclave that resulted in Francisâ€™ succession); and the birth of Prince George, the latest addition to the British royal family (131 minutes). The continued fighting in Afghanistan came in just behind the new prince at 121 minutes for the entire year. The strong showings by the papal succession, Mandelaâ€™s death, and Prince Georgeâ€™s birth all demonstrated the rise of â€œcelebrity journalismâ€ in news coverage, Andrew Tyndall, the reportâ€™s publisher, told IPS.  He added that â€œa minor celebrity like Oscar Pistorius (the South African so-called â€œBladerunnerâ€ track star accused of murdering his girlfriend) attracted more coverage  than all the rest of sub-Saharan Africa in the  months before Mandelaâ€™s death. â€Surveys by the Pew Research Centre for the People & the Press, among other polling and research groups, show that about two-thirds of the general public cite television as their main source for national and international news, more than twice the number of people who rely on newspapers, and about one-third more than the growing number of individuals whose primary source is the internet. An average of about 21 million U. S.  residents watch the network news on any given evening.  While the cable news channels â€" CNN, FoxNews, and MSNBC â€" often get more public attention, their audience is actually many times smaller, according to media-watchers. â€œIn 2012, more than four times as many people watched the three network newscasts than watched the highest-rated show on the three cable channels during prime time,â€ Emily Guskin, a research analyst for the Pew Research Centreâ€™s Journalism Project, told IPS. As in other recent years, news about the weather â€" especially its extremes and the damage they wrought â€" received a lot of attention on the network news, although, also consistent with past performance, the possible relationship between extreme weather and climate change was rarely, if ever, drawn by reporters or anchors. Last yearâ€™s tornado season, severe winter weather, drought and wild forest fires in the western states constituted three of the top six stories of the year, according to the report.  Along with the aftermath of 2012â€™s Superstorm Sandy, those four topics reaped nearly 900 minutes of coverage on the three networks, or about six percent of the entire yearâ€™s coverage. â€œA major flaw in the television news journalism is its inability to translate anecdotes of extreme weather into the overarching concept of climate change,â€ noted Tyndall.  "As long as these events are presented as meteorological and not climatic, then they will be covered as local and domestic, not global. â€œAn exception in 2013 was Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines,â€ he noted.  That event captured 83 minutes of coverage among the three networks, making it the single biggest story by far out of Asia for the year. By comparison, the growing tensions between Japan and China in the East China Sea â€" which many foreign-policy analysts here rate as one of the most alarming events of the past year if, for no other reason, than the U. S.  is committed by treaty to militarily defend Japanâ€™s territory â€" received a mere eight minutes of coverage. Two other major U. S.  foreign policy challenges received more coverage.  North Korea and the volatile tenure of its young leader, Kim Jong-un, received a total of 87 minutes, including 10 minutes to visiting basketball veteran Dennis Rodman, of coverage during 2013. Events in Iran, including the election of President Hassan Rouhani and negotiations over its nuclear programme, received a total of 104 minutes of coverage between the three networks over the course of the year, nearly as much attention as was given the British royals. Libya received 64 minutes of coverage, but virtually all of it was devoted to the domestic controversy over responsibility for the September 2012 killings of the U. S.  ambassador and three other officials there.  The Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria and the civil war and humanitarian disaster in the Central African Republic received no coverage at all. As for the Israel-Palestinian conflict which Secretary of State John Kerry has made a top priority along with a nuclear deal with Iran, it received only 16 minutes of coverage in 2013.  â€œPalestine has virtually disappeared from the news agenda,â€ noted Tyndall. As has Latin America, which received virtually no attention, according to Tyndall who suggested that the lack of coverage may be due to the growth of Spanish-language networks here.  â€œThe assumption seems to be that anyone interested in Latin American coverage would likely speak Spanish and find it in that language. â€Altogether, the three networks devoted just under 4,000 minutes, or about 27 percent of total air time, to coverage of overseas stories or U. S.  foreign policy.  That was somewhat under the average amount of 25-year average.  Indeed, the 1,302 minutesâ€™ worth of stories focused on U. S.  foreign policy marked a nearly 50-percent reduction from the average. â€œIn general, foreign policy coverage has risen when the president is bellicose,â€ according to Tyndall, who noted that such coverage had risen sharply as a result of armed conflicts during the administrations of the two Presidents Bush and fallen under Presidents Clinton and Obama. But the collection by the National Security Agency (NSA) of â€œmetadataâ€ on U. S.  citizens and of private conversations and email of foreign leaders as disclosed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden â€" a story with both domestic and international repercussions â€" also placed among the top 10 stories of the year with 210 minutes of coverage.
