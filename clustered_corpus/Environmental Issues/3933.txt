China is not happy.  This is how one of the Chinese state-sanctioned  newspapers summed up Beijing’s feelings about the week spent negotiating on  climate change in the Danish capital. After a very public showdown with the United States in the early days of the  global climate talks, China found itself attacked by smaller developing  countries for benefiting more than anyone else from carbon credit funding.   And as the countdown to the end of negotiations began, Beijing was seen  deflecting criticism that it was the stumbling block to reaching a deal. Describing the fighting camps in Copenhagen in terms borrowed from the  famous 'Art of War of Suntzu,' the ‘China Times’ newspaper said Beijing’s  gloom about the talks was growing and there was no sign of any 'ceasefire'  in sight. The ongoing United Nations climate change conference in the Danish capital,  which began on Dec.  7, is now in its final phase.  Within government circles and environmental lobbies alike, there is clear  awareness of the importance of China’s role in reaching an agreement. 'This is the first time for China to work on green cooperation internationally,'  says Hu Angang, prominent economist and campaigner for low-carbon  future.  'Beijing knows that if we succeed, then the world succeeds; if China  fails, then the world fails. '   The talks have reached an impasse due to long-standing rifts between rich  and poor countries, and a fresh division that has emerged among developing  countries.  China has featured prominently in both standoffs and Beijing  appears worried that it is becoming a target of criticism over the deadlock. 'People will say ‘if there is no deal, China is to blame’,' deputy foreign  minister He Yafei said in an interview with the ‘Financial Times’ published this  week.  'This is a trick played by developed countries.  They have to look at  their own position and can't use China as an excuse.  China will not be an  obstacle [to a deal]. '        On Tuesday China accused developed countries of backsliding on what it said  were their obligations to fight climate change and warned that climate  negotiations had entered a critical stage. In sharp comments made at a press briefing in Beijing, foreign ministry  spokeswoman Jiang Yu said there had been 'some regression' on the part of  developed countries on their position regarding financial support.  The change  in their position 'will hamper the Copenhagen conference,' she said. China and the United States — the world’s two largest carbon polluters — have  waged a war of words at Copenhagen.  They have clashed on key issues such  as how to share out the burden of slashing greenhouse gases (GHGs) and  whether the United States owes developing countries a 'climate debt'. Beijing says western nations have built their prosperity on fossil fuels and  need to shoulder the responsibility for reducing the growth of global GHG  emissions.  The International Atomic Agency — an intergovernmental forum on  nuclear energy — however, projects that nearly all the growth in those gases  over the next two decades will come from emerging economies and half of it  from China. The United States has rejected the idea of 'climate reparations' and  questioned the need for China — now the fastest-growing economy in the  world — to receive a portion of the rich nations’ funding to help developing  countries mitigate climate change. 'I don’t envision public funds — certainly not from the United States — going to  China,' Todd Stern, the chief U. S.  climate negotiator, told a press briefing in  Copenhagen last week.  While poorer developing countries still needed  western help to nurture clean-energy technologies, this was no longer the  case with China, he argued. China has vowed to reduce carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic  product by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, but experts say, given economic growth  projections, its emissions could still double compared to 2005 levels. The country has appeared in Copenhagen championing the interests of the  developing nations but it has faced rows among its own lobby.  Dozens of the  poorest countries led by the tiny Pacific island of Tuvalu have called for  mandatory caps on greenhouse gases for major emerging economies such as  China starting in 2013. China has been consistently refusing binding emissions caps for fears it  would hurt its spectacular economic rise.  It reiterated this position in  Copenhagen.  But in a gesture aimed at mending relations with its  underdeveloped allies, Beijing hinted it was willing to give up its share of  funding provided by rich nations to help poorer countries tackle climate  change. 'Financial resources for the efforts of developing countries (to combat climate  change are) a legal obligation… That does not mean China will take a share —  probably not … We do not expect money will flow from the U. S. , Britain and  others to China,' He Yafei told the ‘Financial Times’.   Analysts believe the statement was a sign of Beijing’s unease over the fragile  unity of developing countries and the implications of the row for the progress  of the talks. 'The climate talks will display China’s new world view,' insists Qing Hong,  researcher with the Centre for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based think  tank.  'Contrary to some arguments, China is not always adhering only to its own  national interests.  Quite the opposite, China will show the international  community that in the case of climate change its considerations transcend its  national boundaries,' he says.
