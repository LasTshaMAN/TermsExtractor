A group of Israeli environmentalists is campaigning to prevent oil exploration  inside a nature reserve by the Dead Sea. Tzuk Tamrur 4, named after the nearby promontory, is expected to be the  fourth attempt in the area to dig for oil.  A number of other attempts have so  far failed to discover crude oil, or yielded limited amounts. This time the group of companies carrying out the exploration is confident it  will find oil.  Rami Kremien, managing director of Ginko Oil Exploration, who  is leading the exploration partnership, says up to 6. 5 million oil barrels lie  two kilometres beneath the ground.  One of his partners, however, was quoted last October by the Israeli travel  magazine Masa Acher as saying that the estimate is significantly lower. The first experimental drilling requires a 5,000 square metres site, just a  kilometre from the nature reserve's southern boundary.  The reserve is spread  across 592 square kilometres. 'The expected limited yield of the drilling doesn't justify the endorsement for  a severe and permanent harm to the wildlife, plants, landscape and the  enjoyment of those hiking within the designated nature reserve,' the Society  for the Protection of Nature (SPNI), a nationwide NGO said in a public  announcement. Construction of the drilling facility was approved by the Nature and Parks  Authority in the late 1990s.  It was only a few years later, in 2003, that the  Judean Desert was formally designated as a nature reserve, including the plot  of land of the planned drilling site. In June 2007, the Authority reversed the decision, arguing that the oil  pumping facility could harm the natural assets on the site.  The scientific  committee of the Authority's assembly wrote in June 2008 that 'the oil  drilling and production might harm populations of rare species and prompt  invasive species.  In the long run, this impact might cause the detachment of  populations of desert species - for which the Judean Desert is a world  dispersal boundary - from their main populations in the Negev. ' The border  between the Judean Desert on the northern side and the Negev desert region  stretches roughly from the southern tip of the Dead Sea westwards to  Hebron. But the assembly decided later to allow the drilling facility after all, with a  number of restrictions, and stipulating that in case the project moves into a  production phase Â– that would last a few years - the entrepreneurs would  have to go for diagonal drilling, in which the pumping rig is stationed  outside the nature reserve. Drilling personnel are working with the Nature and Parks Authority to  minimise any environmental impact during two months of test drilling  expected to begin in May.  Should considerable oil be discovered, the size of  the pumping site will be reduced to a tenth of the initial experimental  drilling site, says Kremien. 'Obviously, there is damage,' he told IPS.  'But there's the trade-off of a  minimal and monitored damage - also according to environmentalists and  experts - and the need for discovering oil.  After all, even the most  enthusiastic environmentalists drive polluting petroleum-fuelled cars. 'The environmentalists are concerned over the principle of allowing  development within the fragile nature reserve.  Apparently, such drilling has  no precedence.  'My impression is that the whole issue of this drilling is only  meant for increasing stock exchange profits,' says Shay Tachnai, SPNI's  south district nature conversation coordinator.  'The chances of discovering  oil in this place are small, at least judging by past prospects in the area. ''Each individual case should be examined in a pertinent way,' says Gilad  Gabay, vice-manager of the south district at the Nature and Parks Authority.   In this particular case, he says 'it's clear that the environmental impact will  be harsh.  First, scenic damage, second ecological damage, and third,  marginal impact in an area that is completely undisturbed. 'Nevertheless, says Gabay, 'we have to find the golden mean - to do it in a  rational way, to minimise impact. 'Israel has always been dependent on imported crude oil.  Even if Tzuk Tamrur  4 meets its optimistic expectations, with a national consumption of more  than 220,000 barrels a day, the contribution of the planned drilling would  probably be rather modest. The Ministry for National Infrastructure offered no comment.
