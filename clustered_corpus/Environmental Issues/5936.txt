She spends so much time immersed in water as if she were a mermaid.  But  Jariya Sakayaroj looks like she does not mind even if she ends up developing  scales.    A microbiologist with the Bioresources Technology Unit of the National  Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (BIOTEC), Jariya knows that  the hours she spends wading through Thailand’s coastal areas may result in  discoveries that could one day help battle illnesses like heart disease, cancer,  or osteoporosis.     Jariya trawls the waters for fungi that may harbour bioactive compounds  that could be used for medical treatments.  She says that the unique ecology  of mangroves, with their brackish water rising and falling twice daily,  represents a particularly hostile environment for fungi, making their  resilience especially attractive to pharmaceutical companies.    She warns, though: 'We will never know which ones we might be losing as  the seas warm and storm patterns shift, (taking) the benefits along with  them.  Yes, there are big changes taking place out there that we need to  address, but the microscopic ones need attention too. '    Indeed, while much of the world now considers the declining ice habitat of  polar bears as the main harbinger of ecological losses from advancing climate  change, Thai scientists have been working in relative obscurity as they race  against time to document microspecies in aquatic ecosystems.           Jariya says microorganisms represent one of the largest segments of the  planet’s biological inventory.  But she says that only about 10 percent of the  world’s estimated 1. 5 million microorganisms have been identified so far,  and she fears that many may be disappearing before their compounds are  known.     'Thailand is critical because about 10 percent of the world’s  microorganisms and fungi can be found in here,' she says.          Of the 549 high marine fungi species known to exist in the world, 180 are  found in this South-east Asian country.  Forty of these are new species that  Jariya’s marine fungi unit has discovered over the past decade.           More than 60 years ago, penicillin introduced the world to fungi’s value to  medicine.  But it has only been during the past 15 years that researchers have  been more aggressive in combing the planet for new fungi and bacteria that  can advance medical treatments.           So far, 15 BIOTEC researchers probing marine, fresh water and forest  ecosystems have identified 2,500 new microorganisms and 70 new bioactive  compounds with new biochemical structures.  These are now in the  laboratories of the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis, where they are  undergoing further screening to identify substances that may be effective in  treating diseases.    Novartis came to Thailand in 2005 to partner with Jariya and other BIOTEC  researchers in the quest for new microorganisms from which natural  compounds to use in medicines might be found.  According to BIOTEC about  20 percent of the microorganisms now being studied by Novartis come from  Thailand.           This is a development that has some Thai experts wary, however.  For  instance, pharmacologist and herbal medicine expert Supaporn Pitiporn of the  Abhaibhubejhr Hospital in the eastern province of Prachin Buri points out that  while Jariya’s work is critical, Thailand must keep close tabs on the bioactive  compounds discovered within its borders.           'The benefits of fungi in particular are invaluable, used in many traditional  healings, including detoxification, and as nutrient supplements,' says  Supaporn, who turned her hospital’s herbal products into national best- selling healthcare products.     'However,' she says, 'the government has been a pretty poor protector of  the intellectual property rights, and we’re seeing these treatments being  stolen, marketed, and generating profit for mainstream pharmaceutical  interest. '          Traditional Thai healers acknowledge the efficacy of microorganisms in  mushrooms to treat several diseases.  The Reishi mushroom, for example, is  used to delay tumour growth, as well as to stimulate the immune system.  The  Boletus mushroom, meanwhile, is recommended for those with tuberculosis.     Proteolytic bacteria from Thai traditional fermented foodstuff have also  been found to have allergenic reducing potentials to wheat and milk  allergens.    Yet while the potential loss of intellectual rights over Thailand’s  microorganisms is worrisome, Thai researchers also say that it is equally  important that people realise that even the tiniest of species can be a player  in climate change mitigation.    Microorganisms like algae are already being scrutinised as potential sources  for sustainable energy, while even the dangerous E.  coli bacteria that cause  most cases of food poisoning may soon be transformed into biological  factories to make biofuels.      'We’re just now beginning to really explore what microorganism can offer  us,' says Supaporn, 'so efforts to protect the ecosystems to sustain them are  becoming increasingly important. '    Also critical, observes Visut Baimai, head of the Biodiversity Research and  Training Programme, is the role species monitoring plays in helping Thailand  to better understand the direction climate change is taking.    Says the biologist: 'While so many resources are invested in sophisticated  climate models, observations of plant and animal responses to the rise in the  ambient temperatures of their habitats can tell us a lot. '      That includes the  tracking of microorganisms.  According to Visut, the further documentation of  species big and small could only help accelerate public support for more  aggressive climate change policies.     'Thai people are more concerned with animals than they are graphs and  charts,' he says.  'For better or worse, they need to see these kinds of impact  before they will feel compelled to act.
