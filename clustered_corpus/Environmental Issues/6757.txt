After all the turbines in the Xiaowan hydropower station sputtered to life this  week in China’s south-west Yunnan province, the Asian giant was able to lay  claim to having the world’s largest hydropower capacity.    A 'great leap forward' was how Liu Qi, deputy director of the National  Energy Administration, described the expanding hydropower muscle of the  country, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.    'The rapid development of the hydropower industry is of great significance  to optimising China’s energy structure and reducing carbon emissions,' Sun  Yucai, executive vice chairman of the China Electricity Council, said in the  same report.    The 700,000-kilowatt scheme of the Xiaowan power station is expected to  push China’s installed hydropower capacity to 200 million kilowatts, Xinhua  reported.  The country’s second largest hydropower project, which cost 5. 86  billion U. S.  dollars, can 'produce 19 billion KW hours of electricity every year,  it added.    This power station will receive water from another showpiece of Chinese  power: the Xiaowan dam, the world’s tallest double-arch dam with a storage  capacity of close to 15 billion cubic metres.    The Xiaowan is the fourth dam that the Chinese have built out among a  planned eight cascades of dams in the upper part of the Mekong River -  which the Chinese call the Lancang - that flows through the mountainous  Yunnan terrain.  The Xiaowan Dam began impounding the Mekong's waters in  October 2009, nearly two decades after the Manwan, the first among these  dams, started to harness the waters of the 4,660-kilometre-long river.    But China’s celebration of its dam-building feats, coming nearly 100 years  after it built its first hydropower station near Kunming, the provincial capital  of Yunnan, will not be shared by countries in the lower stretches of the  Mekong, say activists.    Many downstream communities have been reporting erratic water levels in  the Mekong and blame this on China’s construction of dams on the Lancang.    Following drops to the river’s lowest levels in 50 years, green groups and  sections of the media blamed the Chinese dams — particularly the Xiaowan —  for affecting the livelihood of riverine villages in Burma, Cambodia, Laos,  Thailand and Vietnam.    A Chinese government effort in March to explain that these were due to a  severe drought did little to ease the worries of villagers who depend on the  river’s ecosystem and fish catch for an income.    Fishing is the main source of livelihood for the 60 million people living in  the Mekong basin, and the annual income from fisheries in the lower Mekong  is between two to three billion U. S.  dollars.    'Many people living in the lower Mekong region will still believe that the  filling of the Xiaowan dam reservoir contributes to a drop in the water level  during the dry season,' says Ame Trandem, Mekong campaigner for  International Rivers, an U. S. -based environmental lobby.  'It will remain so  until the Chinese make public all the information related to its dam  operations. '   China’s offer of some information about its dams to the Mekong River  Commission (MRC) is insufficient, she told IPS.  'China has been taking  positive steps to be cooperative by releasing some details.  But it still needs to  be willing to be more accountable and transparent, since local communities  have not seen the information given to the MRC. '   The MRC, an inter-governmental organisation whose members include  Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, says China’s dams do not have the  capacity to influence water levels all the way downstream, because much of  the Mekong’s waters come from lower basin countries.         'The MRC doesn’t anticipate that the Xiaowan dam will have a significant  influence downstream on the lower Mekong,' says MRC spokesman Damian  Kean, echoing views that the Vientiane-based organisation aired when the  Chinese dams were under fire early this year.    But 'later on, as more and more dams come online, you are going to see a  greater impact,' he told IPS from the Lao capital.  'All the lower Mekong  countries want to see the right decision being made in this sector. '   At the same time, China is well aware that the impact of its dams on the  Mekong — which flows from the Tibetan plateau, through Yunnan, then passes  Burma before snaking its way through the basin to empty out into the South  China Sea in southern Vietnam — is not limited to the countries that share  South-east Asia’s largest body of water.    Since July, Beijing has also had to contend with the U. S.  government, which  has been reviving Washington’s involvement in the region after the  disengagement by the administration of George W Bush.     In fact, U. S.  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s push for greater cooperation  between Washington and the Mekong basin countries during a visit to  Thailand in July 2009 spurred warnings from U. S.  experts about the danger  that China’s hydropower ambitions pose to other Mekong countries.    China’s dam plans will turn the Mekong into a 'Chinese River', warned  Richard Cronin, the South-east Asian head of the U. S. -based Stimson Centre,  in Bangkok this month.    In an August article, the Washington-based ‘Foreign Policy’ publication  urged the U. S.  government to step into the fray.  'Washington’s willingness to  get involved in the Mekong River dispute could create an almost perfect  counterweight to China’s strategy,' wrote John Lee, visiting fellow at the  Hudson Institute in Washington D. C.    For now, Beijing’s response to growing U. S.  criticism is to pursue ‘soft  power’ diplomacy, says a regional analyst.  'China wants to assure  governments in the lower Mekong that they have nothing to fear. '
