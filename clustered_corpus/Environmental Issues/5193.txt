Climate change and the probability that a current water shortage would worsen  may make constantly bickering neighbours, India and Pakistan, take a closer  look at a 50-year-old treaty under which they share rivers originating from the  Himalayas.    And while the latest official annual meeting regarding the treaty ended  inconclusively in Lahore in March, experts say the two countries would do  well to keep talking about the water resources they share.     Danish Mustafa, a water specialist and geography professor at King’s  College in London, even says that a review of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT)  may 'be a conduit for encouraging greater trust and interaction in other  spheres'.    After all, since gaining independence from Britain 60 years ago, India and  Pakistan have never seemed to run out of things to quarrel over.     At a Mar.  28-30 journalists’ conference here in the Pakistani capital that  focused on regional tensions from water resources, the need for cross- border dialogue to prevent water from becoming a flashpoint of conflict was  also discussed.     Indeed, such concerns have once more brought to fore the IWT, which was  brokered in 1960 by the World Bank that also acted as guarantor.  Under the  agreement, India would take the three eastern rivers — Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas —  while Pakistan would have the western rivers — Jhelum, Chenab, and Sindh.      But the treaty also gives India, which is the upper riparian country, certain  rights over the western rivers including domestic use, navigation, limited  agriculture and generation of hydropower.  Experts say, though, that it  prohibits construction aimed at facilitating storage or diversion of the river  by India.      At the media conference organised by LEAD Pakistan, a non-profit group  working for environment and development, experts stressed that the  worsening water shortage in Pakistan highlights the need for India and  Pakistan to revisit the Indus water agreement.    'Pakistan has virtually reached the limits of surface water diversion and  groundwater abstraction after a period of rapid expansion following Mangla  and Tarbela dams, and installation of a million tube-wells and turbines,' Syed  Ayub Qutub, an Islamabad-based specialist on water management, said in an  interview.    Water availability in Pakistan has plummeted from about 5,000 cubic metres  per capita in the early 1950s to less than 1,500 per capita today.    'Pakistan is a largely arid or semi-arid country with less than seven percent  of its land area receiving more than 500 millimetres of rain,' he added.  'The  country relies on irrigation for more than 90 percent of its food and fibre  production. '      Daniyal Hashmi, a civil engineer in Pakistan’s Water and Power Development  Authority, noted that when the IWT was negotiated, the three western rivers  had sufficient water to support the country’s irrigated agriculture.  The  cropping intensity then was about 70 percent, he told IPS.     'The Indus irrigation system was designed for this cropping intensity,' he  explained.  'But over the years, cropping intensity increased to about 170  percent. '    'At that time the phenomenon of climate change was not known,' Hashmi  added.  'Similarly, minimum flows required for maintaining the ecology of the  rivers was also not an issue. '     Qutub confirmed this even as he said that the treaty’s flaws included its  failure to conform to major international water laws and conventions.  He  concurred with others at the conference who said that India’s apparent  inability to share with Pakistan accurate data about projects in the IWT rivers  was a sore point in the arrangement.     'India failed to share data, developed new hydroelectric projects on the  western rivers, constructing the Wullar Barrage and storage works on the  Jhelum Main without informing Pakistan, and creating live storage capacities  behind the barrage far in excess of the treaty allowance,' said Qutub.    But he asked as well: 'Why didn’t Pakistan invoke the provisions of IWT for  more than two decades?'    Qutub says that Pakistan knew as early as 1984 that India was not  complying with some of its obligations under the Indus treaty.   'The record  may reveal negligence by the national leadership, both political and military,  as well as bureaucratic buckpassing,' he said.       'Pakistan wastes twice the amount of water each year in watercourses than  could be stored at Tarbela dam (on the Indus) when it was built (in 1974),'  Qutub pointed out.  'We grow sugarcane and low-value rice, called Irri, with  our precious water resources, when we could import these items at lower  cost to the consumers.  Head-end farmers steal much of the water of their  downstream neighbours. '   'First,' said Qutub, 'we should correct these mistakes. '    He also disagreed with those who saw dark war clouds looming over  Pakistan and India because of water.  'Nations generally cooperate, not go to  war, over water. '   Water specialist Mustafa added: 'There is no harm in reviewing the treaty in  the light of climate change, but it needs creative thinking. '          The prospect of this happening is rather slim, Mustafa himself conceded.   But on the off-chance that the treaty would be reviewed, he suggested that  the two sides look into the base flow for the three eastern rivers.     'In a climate-change future, those base flows are going to be all the more  critical for the health of the ecological systems in downstream Pakistan,' said  Mustafa.  'In return, Pakistan could allow equivalent of base flows in eastern  rivers from its three western rivers for India to use. '
