Green activists in India have chalked up a series of successes recently and feel  heartened that the central government is heeding their call.  A number of mega  projects which would have displaced vulnerable communities or caused damage  to the environment were recently scrapped by the government. The latest victory was in preventing the multinational group Vedanta from  opening up bauxite mines in the eastern state of Orissa and trampling on the  rights of the local tribal population.  Last week, a 600-megawatt dam across the Bhagirathi river in the Himalayan  state of Uttarakhand, was abandoned.  Though a group of ministers had said  in June that the project could not be cancelled because of the financial  commitments already made, activists forced them to reverse the decision. The public sector National Thermal Power Corporation had invested 140  million dollars on the dam and placed orders worth 500 million dollars for  equipment and other supplies.  ''This contrasts sharply with the experiences of non-government  organisations (NGOs) and project-affected people so far,'' said Himanshu  Thakkar, hydrologist and convenor of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers  and People. Thakkar feels the union government's newfound receptivity can be largely  attributed to environment minister Jairam Ramesh, who seems to be  sympathetic to global concerns on conservation. Ramesh is a graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay who  continued his studies in the U. S. , as well as a founder of the Indian School of  Business in Hyderabad, one of the world's top 10 B-schools.  The minister  does not shy away from controversies, readily taking on powerful vested  interests -- whether they are cabinet colleagues or mining maharajas. Ramesh's ministry is now adding final touches to the Green India Mission  which seeks to raise the country's forest cover from 23 percent of its land  mass to 33 percent, by engaging local residents, elected bodies and  entrepreneurs.  Last week, a four-man committee appointed by Ramesh's ministry threw the  book at the 70 billion dollar Vedanta group, sealing the fate of its 1. 7 billion  dollar bauxite project that has been found trampling on the rights of the local  Dongaria Kondh and Kutia Kondh tribes in the eastern state Orissa and  wreaking havoc on the environment with a smelter and refinery.  The coup de  grace on the operation was delivered on Aug.  24. As a result of a sustained six-year-old campaign by international NGOs, the  Church of England had, in February, announced withdrawing its investment in  the company saying it was 'not satisfied that Vedanta has shown, or is likely  in future to show, the level of respect for human rights and local communities  that we expect. ' An even bigger project in Orissa to fall foul of Ramesh's ministry for violating  tribal rights is run by POSCO, the South Korean steel giant.  This 13-billion- dollar project, begun five years ago as India's biggest foreign direct  investment, has been accused of irregular land acquisition, which includes  3,000 acres of forest land.        A pressing reason for the government's responsiveness may be the need to  address violent Maoist insurgencies in the mineral-rich tribal areas of central  and eastern India. In a string of attacks on security forces this year more than 100 policemen  were killed.  But the central government refused to deploy troops against the  Maoists, and treats the insurgency as a development issue.  The government proposes to bring in legislation which will ensure that 26  percent of the profits are given as compensation to the people displaced by  mining operations, minister for mines B. K.  Handique told Parliament last  week.  According to E. A. S.  Sarma, a former career bureaucrat who now runs Forum  for a Better Visakha, an influential green NGO in Andhra Pradesh, the central  and state governments cannot always plead innocence when it comes to  collusion with mega projects. '(In the Vedanta case) the government may have (halted the operations), but  what about prosecuting the officials, the company and its directors, and the  political leadership that lobbied for Vedanta,'' Sarma told IPS. Sarma said the same held good for the privately-owned Nagarjuna  Construction Company which was to build a three-billion-dollar, 2,000 MW  coal-fired power plant at Sompeta town in the ecologically fragile Srikakulam  district of Andhra Pradesh. On Jul.  15, two villagers were killed as the police, supported by goons hired  by the company, ruthlessly crushed an agitation by activists.  Collusion  between the state government and Nagarjuna Construction was visible on TV  news coverage as the goons, easily identified by their blue headbands,  assisted the police in forcing their way into the site and attacking the  protesters. Later, the National Environment Appellate Authority (NEAA) ruled against the  project saying that the land allotted was part of a wetland system and  provided water and livelihoods for people in the neighbouring villages. 'The NEAA has ordered a detailed survey and assessment of the wetlands, but  the state government should have taken these measures much earlier,' Sarma  said.  'Environmental activism is still not an easy task,'' Sarma added.  ''Those who  ask the government to obey the law of the land are frowned upon and those  that violate the law are respected in the corridors of power in New Delhi and  the state capitals. ''
