Buy a hairpin and the sales clerk has a microscopic plastic bag for it.  A soda  purchase from a corner store may end up having the liquid poured into a plastic  bag, and then topped off with a plastic straw.  There is no plastic bag yet that  could fit a car, but if there was one country that could come up with one,  Thailand would probably be it.    But here in the capital, local authorities have restarted a campaign to wean  the residents of the Thai capital from their plastic bag ‘addiction’.     For the second year in a row, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration  (BMA) is holding its 45-day 'No Bag, No Baht' project, which offers consumers  a one-baht (three U. S.  cents) discount for every 100 baht (nearly three dollars)  purchase if they use their own cloth bags when shopping in several local  markets.  Meanwhile, each plastic bag will cost them one baht.    This year’s BMA campaign was launched on Jun.  5, World Environment Day.   Last year, the campaign targeted a cutback of 4. 4 million plastic bags among  Bangkok consumers.  This year, BMA authorities want a cutback that is three  times that figure.    BMA figures show that every day, more than 600,000 plastic bags are used  in this city of nine million people.     Their annual disposal cost reaches more than 600 million baht (18. 4 million  dollars), city officials have said.  Local media have quoted BMA deputy  governor Porntep Techapaibul as saying that of the city’s daily 10,000 tonnes  of trash, about 1,800 tonnes are plastic bags, a number projected to increase  by about 20 percent each year.    By now, many Bangkok residents have heard of the health and  environmental hazards posed by plastic bags.  Made from a non-renewable  natural resource, petroleum, the bags have for their main ingredient  polyethylene — or polythene — which is said to take 1,000 years to  decompose on land and 450 years in water.    But even green-minded residents have problems avoiding the use of plastic  bags.  Thai Fund Foundation coordinator Chomphu Rammuang says that  although she brings a big cloth bag to the supermarket and a lunch pack to  work, she can still wind up with a plastic bag in hand by day’s end.      Thailand, after all, is a major manufacturer of plastic.  That could help  explain why even micro-entrepreneurs here think nothing of shoving their  merchandise in plastic bags.     For instance, Yakult health drink vendor Suprathit says that a 100-piece  pack of small plastic bags costs her only five baht (15 cents).  Pusadee, who  sells office lunches in clear plastic bags, also says she buys a kilo of these for  70 baht (two dollars).  She says a kilo’s supply lasts her two days.    Thailand produces other plastic products.  According to Greenpeace South- east Asia-Thailand country representative Tara Buakamsri, the country is  among South-east Asia’s biggest manufacturers of polyvinyl chloride (PVC),  which is the third most widely produced plastic after polythylene and  polypropylene.     Cheap, durable and easy to assemble, it is often used to make pipes, water  bottles, credit cards.  It is also non-biodegradable.    In April, the English-language daily 'Bangkok Post' reported that domestic  demand for PVC is about 450,000 tonnes per year.     A study presented in 2009 by Wuthichai Wongthatsanekorn at the World  Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology in Dubai, says that the  recovery rate of plastic waste in Thailand in 2000 was only 23 percent.    It also says that only about 35 percent of the solid wastes collected from  parts of Thailand outside of Bangkok are properly managed, while the rest of  the waste products are 'piled up in open dumping areas waiting to be  dissolved. '   For a campaign to be effective, Tara says, consumers have to be aware of  the importance and the long-term effect of the scheme.    'We need to study what economic mechanism will work if plastic bags are  banned in Thailand,' he says.  'What would be the reaction of the huge plastic  industry in the country? What will be the economic incentive for people to  follow this campaign?'   The good news, though, is that many establishments like supermarket chain  Tesco Lotus and furniture store Home Pro are open to taking part in the BMA  project.  In fact, even before the 'No Bag, No Baht' project was relaunched,  Tesco Lotus already had its very own 'Green Bag Green Point' campaign.  For  each bag saved, a customer can earn one Green Clubcard point.    Tesco Lotus senior corporate affairs manager Saofang Ekaluckrujee told IPS  in an email interview, 'We are very pleased to see policymakers such as the  BMA making this issue a national priority.  Our Green Bag Green Point  scheme's initial target is to reduce plastic bag usage by 9. 8 million bags in  2010. '        Other huge shopping malls like Siam Paragon and Central also give  incentives like bonus shopper points for not using their bags — plastic or  paper ones for that matter — or a 5 percent discount at certain times of the  month.    Even small businesses are joining in.  During the BMA campaign’s soft  relaunch in May, than 5,000 stores in Bangkok’s famous Chatuchak weekend  market participated.    Chomphu also reports that her monthly visits to the Chatuchak weekend  market have become a pleasant experience, plastic bag-wise.   'The vegetarian  store near Chatuchak that I go to is actively participating in the project,' she  says.  'Buyers are encouraged to bring their own bags. '
