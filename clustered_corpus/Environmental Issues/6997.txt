With a gas-guzzler of an economy, India had been spending tens  of billions of dollars annually to import petroleum.  And so  its 2009 policy on biofuels mandated that by 2017, India would  have enough biofuel production to cover at least 20 percent of  the country’s oil consumption.    The government has in fact been encouraging the  cultivation of jatropha curcas for the past seven years,  believing that would be the fastest way to have the volume  of biofuel the country would need — 13 million tonnes, or 30  times more biodiesel than what is being produced at present.     But now, even green groups are saying India’s biofuel  efforts have fallen into a rut.    In fact, Suneel Parasnis, Asia coordinator of Private  Financing Advisory Network (PFAN), a multilateral agency  bringing innovative clean energy projects to interested  investors, says, 'Biofuels have failed because of  unavailability and high price of stock feed for biodiesel  processing plants all over India. '   Yet banker-turned-biofuel producer Sreenivas Ghatty  retorts, 'That’s because we put the cart before the horse. '   Indeed, inadequate preparation and understanding seem to  have been major contributors to India’s bumpy trip of its  biofuel programme.  But so too has been the greed of fly-by- night operators who made quick profits by selling seeds,  saplings, and unrealistic dreams of profit to gullible  farmers.    At first glance, jatropha seemed to be the perfect  biofuel source for India, just as it has been touted for  many developing countries.  For one, it was touted for having  the ability to grow on  ‘waste’ land, thus skirting a fuel- versus-food conflict.  For another, each of its seeds can  have as much as 40-percent oil content.   The plant itself is  carbon-neutral as well, absorbing as much carbon dioxide as  it releases later as fuel.    A federal planning commission report in 2003 also said  that potentially 36 million hectares in India — mostly  government waste and forest land, land beside railway tracks  and protective hedge around private agro-farms — were ideal  for jatropha plantations.  By 2006, many Indian farmers and  oil companies were growing jatropha, their enthusiasm  fuelled by land and tax incentives offered by the  government.    Farmers have since discovered that jatropha produces much  higher yields on fertile, irrigated land and needs chemical  fertilisers as well.  And while it may survive on ‘waste’  land, it will not grow in volumes that would pay off for  small-time farmers.    'One of the biggest problems is having farmers pull out  of jatropha before fruit- bearing starts by the third year,'  says K Koteshwar Rao of Nandan Biomatrix, an integrated  biofuel research-producer here in Hyderabad, which recently  acquired global patents for higher oil-yield genotypes of  jatropha.  'For the next 35 years they need only tend and  harvest, but they run out of patience. '   'We are (also) advising multi-cropping of dryland  legumes, pulses, and oilseeds to sustain the initial no- income period,' he adds.     According to Rao, one jatropha shrub at its full-grown  height of three metres would need 'up to two litres of  survival watering per non-rainy day'.    'One deep bore well could suffice for a 50-hectare  plantation,' he adds.   'Nutrient requirement per hectare  works out to 50 to70 kilogramme nitrogen, 50 kg phosphorous,  70 kg potassium, along with 30 kg sulphur. '   'Going for large-scale plantations without the proper set  of practices is risky, and more importance should be given  to research and development work focusing on the genetic  improvement of the species, and agronomic practices,' he  cautions.    Unsurprisingly, state governments that had proactively  established separate entities to promote jatropha biodiesel  just five years ago are less enthusiastic today.      The central state of Chhattisgarh, for instance, was  revving up to become India’s jatropha hub in 2005.  A check  of Chhattisgarh Bio-fuel Development Authority’s website  reveals that the last entry under its ‘achievements’ is  dated September 2007.    Big-time investors, however, remain attracted by the  prospect of biofuel profits — and sometimes use questionable  means to get these, say activists.    'Land grabs by private biofuel investors are high in  poorest and least resistant areas in eastern state of Orissa  and Central India,' says activist Puspanjali Satpathy of the  Bhubaneswar-based environmental non-profit group Vasundhara.    Just this year in Bolangir, Orissa, private enterprises,  including a technical college, lured farmers into growing  jatropha by offering 175 U. S.  dollar loans to buy seeds and  saplings.  Under the scheme, the loans would be repaid from  jatropha seed harvests.  But the deal has apparently been set  up in such a way that by harvest time three years later, the  farmers would have already lost these very lands to an  irrigation project there.    In Patnagarh, in the same district in Orissa, about 162  hectares were bought by a Delhi-based private enterprise in  2005.  But now the former landowners — local farmers — say  that they had been led to think the deal, which they say had  been brokered by district officials, was a three-year lease  agreement.  The angry villagers are taking legal recourse to  get back their land.    All these have left firm biofuel believers like Ghatty  frustrated.  Now a consultant based in Melbourne, Australia,  Ghatty insists, '(Alternative) energy sources need to be  developed — there are no two ways about that.  Biofuels are  the cheapest and the most sustainable alternative. '        He points out that jatropha biodiesel can be produced and  consumed locally in remote areas — to run irrigation pumps  and lighter transport vehicles, and light up homes.  But, he  says, the policies for grassroots energy security must be  clear-cut.    These policies 'should lead to energy self-sufficiency in  regional, remote areas, promoting area development', says  Satpathy.  'But first, we need a social audit on biofuels. '
