It may not be easy to imagine Japan as a jolly green giant,  but to several Asian countries that have been enjoying  environmental projects funded by Japanese aid, that’s what  this nation has resembled in the last two decades.    Since the early 1990s, Japan has been involved in several  green initiatives across Asia, with its participation  usually in the form of overseas development assistance (ODA)  loans, grants, and technology transfer.    One of the most recent ones, in fact, addresses some of  the impacts of climate change in agriculture, and has taken  one of Japan’s foremost agriculture development experts to  northern Thailand.    According to Dr Masato Oda, the project he has been  overseeing there in the last year or so has been helping  farmers use less water to grow their crops.  And because the  approach demands neither high technology nor vast amounts of  money, it can be replicated elsewhere in Thailand and  beyond.    Oda says that the methodology they are using in Thailand  would be useful in other Asian countries such as Cambodia,  where constant droughts have forced farmers to keep a  demanding irrigation schedule.     'The beauty of the whole project is that farmers… do not  have to be rocket scientists to succeed,' he says.  'All they  need to know is to work harder on crop growing and few other  important conditions such as the selection of high quality  seeds, all steps that are not beyond their reach. '    The soil in Thailand’s north is classified as sandy.   Annual rainfall there is between 800 to 1,000 millilitres  over six months out of the year, but the remaining months  usually mean drought-like conditions.     Northern Thailand farmers, however, have managed to grow  crops (mainly sugarcane) despite these conditions.  But that  has grown more difficult in recent years as temperatures  fluctuate and the dry spells get longer.     Research has shown that farmers resort to a heavy  watering schedule — twice a day — during the drought period.     Oda says that the 12 households included in the project  have been using a new system that has helped to retain at  least 1,000 millilitres of rainfall that is roughly needed  to facilitate crop cultivation on sandy land.     'Farmers now water just once a week and still have good  harvests,' he says, adding that the farmers have also begun  growing tomatoes on once uncultivated areas.    Oda explains that the project approach is to focus on  increasing water retention on the land by growing more crops  on the land and covering the surface.   These two tactics, he  says, essentially decrease water evaporation.    With the need to water their crops reduced immensely, the  farmers no longer spend as much on diesel that they use  their water pumps.     Oda thus says that the new irrigation system contributes  to reducing climate change overall as less pump use means  less emissions that in turn would lead to less pollution.   That, he says, is an important step in helping correct  current erratic weather patterns blamed on global warming.      Several landmarks in Japanese environment aid have been  noted since Tokyo began it almost 20 years ago.  In 2006, for  instance, Japan offered support China a grant of 6. 82  million dollars to combat sulphur dioxide — spewed by acid  rain and which was ruining crops — and yellow sand dust.    In the same year, Japan also extended environment aid to  the Philippines for initiatives like developing the local  recycling industry, as well as for raising awareness on  river protection.    Environment-related projects took about four percent of  annual Japanese ODA during the 1990s.  By 2008, the green  share in ODA had risen to more than 20 percent.    When it began steering ODA monies to green projects,  Tokyo had explained it was reducing the heavy emphasis of  'traditional' aid on infrastructure in developing countries.    Tokyo also said that its then new policy of helping Asia  protect its environment was based on Japan’s own experience  in combating widespread pollution during the years when it  was going through rapid economic development.    This was during the ‘60s and ‘70s, when Japan’s  petrochemical refineries were built to help power the  country’s manufacturing ambitions.  Yet while Japan did grow  into an economic might, it paid for that success with its  people’s health as severe air pollution led to tens of  thousands of Japanese suffering from asthma.     In 2004, Japanese green aid, through the Japan Fund for  Global Environment, began to be extended to non-government  organisations working at the grassroots level.    Fund spokesman Takuya Kimura says that in 2008, around  two million dollars (at current exchange rates) supported 27  environment projects, mostly on water preservation and  protection and education at community level.  Twenty-two of  these projects were in Asia, specifically Burma, India, and  the Mekong Delta area.    Overall, though, experts point out that Japanese green  aid has been low-key, in large part because of the lack of  clear policy coupled with recent ODA budget cuts.    As a result, says a Stockholm School of Economics report,  Japanese environment aid is becoming politicised as  disbursement is based on recipient requests.    Waseda Environment Academy director Takeshi Hara says the  best environmental aid is when Japan supports programmes  that take into account ecology that supports human  development.        'What we see now is a heavy focus on market-oriented aid  policy based on Japan’s green technology transfer and  fostering a new market as the answer to environmental  issues,' remarks Hara.  'This is not what Japan should be  doing. ' * This IPS story is part of a series supported by the  Climate and Development Knowledge Network  http://www. cdkn. org.
