'People used to mock me, saying that I am competing with dogs for bones, but  these taunts do not deter me,' says Sibongile Mararike with no sign of rancour. The 36-year-old sole breadwinner and mother of four children scavenges for  bones across the sprawling Bulawayo, trudging down the streets of densely  populated working class townships with a dirty bag over her shoulder. The itinerant Mararike rummages through places as diverse as rubbish dumps  and people’s homes, picking up bones that she resells at bone processing  plants in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe’s second largest city with its two million  residents. Bones from people’s dinner tables have over years found their way to  recycling factories and a variety of informal industries in Zimbabwe.  The  socio-economic woes of the past decade have taught bone collectors such as  Mararike a kind of resourcefulness that has seen them appreciate the value of  the same bones that are absent from their meals. Times of plenty mean that plenty of bones fall from the table, so to speak,  thereby providing Mararike with an income.  However, so much has changed  in the past two decades as meat — among a litany of basic commodities - has  disappeared from dinner tables.  Meat has become a luxury many cannot  afford.  For Mararike, who belongs to one of the many poor households that now  have meat only on special occasions, bones have taken a different  significance. She has learnt how cruel life can be in Zimbabwe, despite the euphoria that  greeted the formation of the unity government in 2009.  Hopes of job  creation have turned to nought.  Humanitarian agencies have warned that the  number of Zimbabweans seeking food assistance will rise in 2010 to up to  half of the population. 'I do not want my children to know the poverty they are living through but  there is nothing I can do.  I do not want to collect bones like this but every  cent I can get hold of makes a difference,' Mararike explains.  She sends her school-going children on bone-collecting errands after  classes.  'They are now used to it as they know this is where the money comes  from,' she declares, oblivious to the possibility of courting the censure of  activists opposed to child labour. Mararike has established a rapport with some families who can still afford a  visit to the butchery.  These families stock bones left over from their meals  that she collects once a fortnight or once a month, depending on the weight.   She has a target weight that she has to meet at the bone recycling factory. Only a few such companies remain in Bulawayo.  There has been a decline in  people selling bones because of the drop in meat consumption.  'We no  longer get many people coming here to sell bones as they used to in the late  1990s,' according to Topson Mwale, an old hand who works at a factory that  buys bones.  A kilogramme sells for about 0. 3 U. S.  dollars. The animal bones go through a process where they are ground and then  made into ersatz porcelain cups, plates, teapots and dinner plates, among  other things, Mwale explained.                                                        Cow hooves (known as 'amangqina' in the vernacular Ndebele) are enjoyed by  many here as a gastronomic delight.  They also provide livelihoods to informal  traders such as 29-year-old Gift Ncube, who seemingly recycles almost  everything that he gets hold of and reincarnates it into attractive cultural  artefacts. 'I collect cow hooves from people’s homes, pubs and mobile kitchens and  turn them into curios where I give them new lives as salt shakers, snuff  holders and key rings, among other things,' the self-taught Ncube explains. 'These artefacts have proven to be popular with tourists,' he tells IPS from his  stall outside Bulawayo’s imposing city hall, built in the colonial era, where he  and other young men have become a permanent feature of the city’s cultural  industries.  Wearing dreadlocks, Ncube has found a source of income trading handmade  wares.  He inscribes pictures based on African rock paintings on the cow  hooves, making it impossible to tell that these were indeed once part of a  living, breathing cow. Ncube’s colleague Japhet Tshuma — who has a tertiary diploma but has found  this more lucrative than formal employment — says hooves have over the  years provided him with a most unlikely, if not curious, source of income.   'People do not believe these things are made from cow hooves,' Tshuma  laughs. 'We are making a living selling the bones of the dead,' he says with a  knowing chuckle, adding that he sometimes makes the long trip to the  country’s resort town and tourism hub of Victoria Falls to sell his wares. The Bulawayo City Hall has become a tourist and curios hunter’s Mecca.   Backpackers can be seen scouring the wares.  'Of course we explain to them  what these artefacts are made from and this makes them even more  interested in buying,' Tshuma says. Amid economic hardship, the few families that can still afford meat provide a  livelihood to Mararike, Tshuma and others — albeit unwittingly.  'Zimbabweans have taught themselves that there is nothing that you cannot  sell.  Selling bones is just one of the things that highlight people’s  desperation,' Peter Sifelani of the Bulawayo Informal Traders Association  points out.
