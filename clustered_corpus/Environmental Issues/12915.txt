Malaysians protesting against an Australian-owned rare earth refinery, that will generate radioactive waste, are determined to agitate until the project is abandoned. 'It is time to shut down the Lynas plant,' said Wong Tack chairman of the Himpunan Hijau (Green Gathering Malay) or HHC that is leading a mass movement against the controversial refinery. On Feb.  26, the HHC organised its biggest ever mass protest in this coastal town, capital of Pahang state, attracting 15,000 ordinary Malaysians as well as prominent public figures, including Anwar Ibrahim, leader of the opposition Pakatan Rayat coalition. Wong Tack told IPS that if the government 'continues to dither' the HHC would organise an even bigger protest at Gebeng, site of the Lynas Advanced Materials Plant (LAMP).  The HHC proved its strength in October 2011 when it organised a 2,000-strong rally at the Taman Gelora beach. According to Wong Tack, Malaysia is seeing a 'green revolt' as people truly feared that the plant will produce radioactive thorium waste that would seriously harm the environment and endanger peopleâ€™s health.
